               James Johnson 241 Final Project

Upon running this program, the user will be prompted to enter their oracle
username and password.
This established connection with the database and is necessary to use this 
interface.

Note on my interface: 
- For many IDs I do not require user input and am able to auto generate the 
correct ID. I do this to avoid multiple things with the same ID and to limit 
user input. I set most ID's = row number when I generated my data, so I use 
this concept to create new IDs.
- I include a makefile for the users convenience
- The promotion option in my general manager is a particulary cool class to run

Running my Program (I have included a makefile):
	- Navigate to my outer directory(jdj221johnson) and run the command 'make'
	- Type 'java -jar jdj221.jar' to run the program
	- If you need to recompile, simply run make again

For adding shipment:
	- prod_id 7 is a good product to create a shipment with because it has 
	  multiple suppliers, which allows the user to pick the one with the best 
	  price.

Deletion in my interfaces:
	- All deletions in my program can only be executed on data entered by 
	  the user (not my original data).
	- I do this because I wish to keep my base data all the same so as not 
	  to mess up relationships in my dataset or mess with Regorks records 
	- So to test deletion the user will need to first add 
	  something (supplier, product, shipment) and then proceed to delete 
	  what they have added

My Program has 4 Interfaces
	- The General Manager interface
	- The Supplier Manager Interface
	- The Product Manager Interface
	- The Shipment Manager Interface

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General Manager Interface
This interface is pretty much a view only interface, and contains several
"sub-interfaces" if you want to call them that. In this interface the user can
select from the following menu options:
	1) View Product Information
		- This takes you to another menu for products that contains
		  other view like functions. 
	2) View Supplier Information
		- This takes you to another menu for suppliers that contains
		  other view like functions
	3) View Shipment Information
		- This takes you to another menu for shipments that contains
		  other view like functions
	4) Order a recall
		- This takes you to another menu that helps you create a recall
	5) Promote Jimmy Johnson
		- This takes you to a menu which enables you to elect to promote 
		  the employee Jimmy Johnson. The user will notice that there exists
		  no option to fire or demote him. This is becasue he is doing
		  such good work that is these functions are not necessary.
	6) Quit

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This interface is the interface one would use to update, add, or delete supplier data.

	6) Delete a Supplier

Credits:
	- Zack Rubenstein gave me the idea of using colors in my terminal 
	- Maxim Vezenov gave me the idea for clearing the terminal when
	  switching classes to make it more clean.
